# Description

This fictitious Scooter Rental Website is built using the React library and demonstrates some playful use of CSS animations.
In this site, the first thing a user sees are the three places a user can visit and rent scooters.
There are 3 scooters that can be rented. Information about types of scooters and rental pricing is shown next.
Below the scooter information is the last section of the website which displays scooter availability and permits the user to make a booking.
The site currently doesn't actual do any booking since it is not connected to any backend therefore a simple tooltip is used to signal to the user the booking was made.
